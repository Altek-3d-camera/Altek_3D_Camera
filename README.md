## Special notice from Altek™ regarding the recent press announcement

Altek has decided to focus on AI Camera business and is announcing IoT-related product, and Tracking product lines this year. Altek will continue to provide Stereo products to its current distribution customers.  Altek will focus our new development on advancing innovative technologies that better support our core businesses.
The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and unavailable for additional orders after Feb 28, 2022.

The following Stereo Product Lines will continue to be supported: AL6100 depth cameras. 

We will also continue the work to support and develop our Altek open source SDK.

In the coming future Altek and AL6100 team will focus our new development on advancing innovative technologies that better support our core businesses and 


## Download and Install

## Ready to Hack!

Our library offers a high level API for using Altek depth cameras (in addition to lower level ones).
The following snippet shows how to start streaming frames and extracting the depth value of a pixel:

```cpp
// Create a Pipeline - this serves as a top-level API for streaming and processing frames
rs2::pipeline p;

// Configure and start the pipeline
p.start();

while (true)
{
    // Block program until frames arrive
    rs2::frameset frames = p.wait_for_frames();

    // Try to get a frame of a depth image
    rs2::depth_frame depth = frames.get_depth_frame();

    // Get the depth frame's dimensions
    float width = depth.get_width();
    float height = depth.get_height();

    // Query the distance from the camera to the object in the center of the image
    float dist_to_center = depth.get_distance(width / 2, height / 2);

    // Print the distance
    std::cout << "The camera is facing an object " << dist_to_center << " meters away \r";
}
```
For more information on the library, please follow our [examples](./examples), and read the [documentation](./doc) to learn more.
